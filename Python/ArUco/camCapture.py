# Initialize the camera capture

        filename = str(id) + ".jpg"  # Create a filename by converting 'id' to a string and appending ".jpg"
        id = id + 1  # Increment the 'id' to ensure a unique filename for the next capture

        # Save the captured frame as a JPG image
        cv2.imwrite(filename, frame)  # Save the 'frame' as an image with the generated filename
        print(f"Saved {filename}")  # Print a message to indicate that the image has been saved

    # Exit the loop if the 'q' key is pressed
    elif key == ord('q'):  # If the 'q' key is pressed
        break  # Exit the while loop, terminating the program

# Release the camera and close all windows
cap.release()  # Release the camera resource
cv2.destroyAllWindows()  # Close all OpenCV windows (including the camera preview)
